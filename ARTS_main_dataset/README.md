# Version notes
We adopted a three-part semantic version number convention consisting of three numbers connected by dots. Where the first number indicates the incorporation of a new set of RTS entries. The second number indicates batch changes or additions to the metadata to the existing data set. The last number indicates minor (less than 10) changes or fixes to the existing metadata.
